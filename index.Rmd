# Welcome! 

I am a computational biologist at [Seattle Children's Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/) (SCRI) in beautiful Seattle, WA. I support collaborative cutting edge computational analysis, as well as providing support to empower researchers to utilize the computational resources at SCRI. I am also continuously engaged in developing and adapting genomics data pipelines using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) tools. 

Previously, I was supporting pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) translational research studies using genomic and transcriptomic 'big data' from next generation sequencing at FHCC. 

My interests include statistical analysis of genomics and transcriptomics sequencing data,  visualizations for complex genomic datasets, and community engagement and  outreach.
