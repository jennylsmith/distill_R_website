# Welcome! 

I am a computational biologist at [Seattle Children's Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/) (SCRI) in beautiful Seattle, WA. I support collaborative cutting edge computational analysis, as well as providing support to empower researchers to utilize the computational resources at SCRI. I am also continuously engaged in developing and adapting genomics data pipelines using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) tools. 

Previously, I was supporting pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) translational research studies using genomic and transcriptomic 'big data' from next generation sequencing at FHCC.
